# SCT_DS_02
Performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset. Handled missing values, transformed features, and visualized survival trends by gender, class, and age. Generated insights with plots and correlation heatmaps for better understanding of data.

# Dataset Overview

The dataset contains information about direct marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese banking institution.

Features include:

- Age, Job, Marital status, Education

- Default status, Housing loan, Personal loan

- Contact type, Last contact duration, Month, Day of week

- Campaign information (#contacts, previous outcome)

- Socioeconomic indicators

Target Variable:

y → whether the client subscribed to a term deposit (yes/no)

# Project Workflow

1. Data Collection – Import the dataset into the workspace.


2. Data Preprocessing – Handle categorical variables, missing values, and prepare features.


3. Model Training – Train a Decision Tree Classifier.


4. Model Evaluation – Assess performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.


5. Visualization – Plot the decision tree to interpret decisions.

# Tools & Technologies

- Python

- Pandas, NumPy

- Scikit-learn

- Matplotlib, Seaborn

# Expected Outcomes

- Prediction of customer subscription (yes/no).

- Identification of most important features affecting decisions.

- Visualization of the decision-making process using a tree structure.

# Future Enhancements
